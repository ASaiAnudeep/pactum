# API Testing (REST)

API Testing in general can greatly improve the efficiency of our testing strategy helping us to deliver software faster than ever. It has many aspects but generally consists of making a request & validating the response. 

* It can be performed at different levels of software development life cycle.
* It can be performed independent of the language used to develop the application. (*java based applications API can be tested in other programming languages*)
* In market there are numerous tools available that allows us to test our APIs by different testing types like *component*, *contract*, *integration* & *e2e*.

Instead of using different tools for each test type, **pactum** comes with all the popular features in a single bundle.

So the question is **Why pactum? & What makes pactum fun & easy?**

* Ability to control the behavior of external services with a powerful mock server. (*once you are familiar with api-testing using pactum make sure to read about component testing*)
* Extremely lightweight (*uses lightweight dependencies by never compromising on the features provided*).
* Quick & easy to send requests & validate responses.
* Not tied with any of the test runners. We are allowed to choose test runners like **mocha**, **cucumber**, **jest** or any other that supports promises. TODO - Examples
* Ideal for *component testing*, *contract testing* & *e2e testing*.
